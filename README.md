# LightPipes-Examples

###Simulations of optical phenomena where diffraction is essential

*LightPipes* is a set of functions written in C++. It is designed to model coherent optical devices when the diffraction is essential. The toolbox consists of a number of functions. Each function represents an optical element or a step in the light propagation. There are apertures, intensity filters, beam-splitters, lenses and models of free space diffraction. There are also more advanced tools for manipulating the phase and amplitude of the light. The program operates on a large data structure, containing square two-dimensional arrays of complex amplitudes of the optical field of the propagating light beam.
The *LightPipes* routines used here are based on the LightPipes C routines written by Gleb Vdovin for Unix, Linux, DOS and OS2 workstations.
