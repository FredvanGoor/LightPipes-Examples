# LightPipes

> Simulations of optical phenomena where diffraction is essential

[![travis-ci](https://api.travis-ci.org/opticspy/lightpipes.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/opticspy/lightpipes)

LightPipes is a set of functions written in C++. It is designed to model coherent optical devices when the diffraction is essential.

The toolbox consists of a number of functions. Each function represents an optical element or a step in the light propagation. There are apertures, intensity filters, beam-splitters, lenses and models of free space diffraction. There are also more advanced tools for manipulating the phase and amplitude of the light. The program operates on a large data structure, containing square two-dimensional arrays of complex amplitudes of the optical field of the propagating light beam.

The LightPipes routines are modifications of the LightPipes C routines written by Gleb Vdovin for Unix, Linux, DOS and OS2 workstations.

Visit the website of **Flexible Optical**: [http://www.okotech.com](http://www.okotech.com), where you can find the source code of *LightPipes* and a *manual*.

## Install

LightPipes support Windows 32bit and 64bit, Macintosh OSX, Linux 32bit and 64bit. It support python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 currently.

The packages is on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LightPipes/), so simply open a terminal window and type at the prompt:

```
pip install LightPipes
```

You can also download packages from [Releases](https://github.com/opticspy/lightpipes/releases).

## Example: Young interferometer

A plane wave is diffracted by two small holes, separated a distance, d. So two more or less spherical waves will propagate from these holes.

The resulting interference pattern on a screen at distance z looks like:

The Python program [Young.py](Examples/Interference/Young.py) described in detail.

The first step in *Python* is to import the *LightPipes* library:

```python
import LightPipes
```

If the *LightPipes* library is successful installed on your computer Python can proceed with the next step.
You probably want to plot the results, so import *matplotlib*:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

I like to work with units. So define them:

```python
m = 1.0
cm = 1e-2*m
mm = 1e-3*m
um = 1e-6*m
nm = 1e-9*m
```

We have to initiate *LightPipes*. This is done with the following command:

```python
LP = LightPipes.Init()
```

Next we define some variables: a wavelength of 20 micrometer , a 30 x 30 mm2 square grid with 250 x 250 pixels.

```python
wavelength = 20*um
size = 30.0*mm
N = 500
```

Now we are ready to start the simulation. The *Begin* command generates a field with amplitude 1.0 and phase zero, a plane wave. So, all the 250 x 250 elements of array, F, contain the complex number: 1.0 + j0.0.
The next commands generate two waves, F1 and F2, which are apertured by the two circular apertures and combined (simply added) by the *BeamMix* command. The combined wavefront is propagated a distance z=30 cm by the *Fresnel* command. After that the intensity is caculated and normalized to 255 (2 -> 255, 1 -> 1.0, 0 -> not normalized) by the *Intensity* command.

```python
F = LP.Begin(size,wavelength,N)
F1 = LP.CircAperture(0.15*mm, -0.6*mm,0, F)
F2 = LP.CircAperture(0.15*mm, 0.6*mm,0, F)    
F = LP.BeamMix(F1,F2)
F = LP.Fresnel(10*cm,F)
I = LP.Intensity(2,F)
```

The result is plotted using the fantastic *matplot* routines. We are not interested in axis around the pattern and we like to write a title above the plot.

```python
plt.imshow(I);
plt.axis('off');
plt.title('intensity pattern')
plt.show()
```
