# LightPipes Examples

###Simulations of optical phenomena where diffraction is essential

*LightPipes* is a set of functions written in C++. It is designed to model coherent optical devices when the diffraction is essential. The toolbox consists of a number of functions. Each function represents an optical element or a step in the light propagation. There are apertures, intensity filters, beam-splitters, lenses and models of free space diffraction. There are also more advanced tools for manipulating the phase and amplitude of the light. The program operates on a large data structure, containing square two-dimensional arrays of complex amplitudes of the optical field of the propagating light beam.
The *LightPipes* routines used here are based on the LightPipes C routines written by Gleb Vdovin for Unix, Linux, DOS and OS2 workstations.

Visit the website of ***Flexible Optical***: [http://www.okotech.com](http://www.okotech.com), where you can find the source code of *LightPipes* and a *manual*.

###Examples
A number of examples can be [downloaded](./download) as "stand-alone" executables for the windows, mac and linux platforms. 
You will find simulations of optical phenomena like interference, diffraction, lasers, etc.

Furthermore a set of "computer experiments" is available for free. These programs are meant to perform optical experiments on set-ups like Fabry Perot interferometer, Fresnel diffraction, Young's experiment, etc. The computer experiments can be done using the computer mouse to measure characteristic points in the intensity distribution. For example, from these measurements the value of the wavelength of the light can be determined. Instructions can be read for each experiment.

###List of examples:
- CO2 laser
- Zernike phase patterns


###Computer experiments:

- Spherical wavefront (inverse square law)
- Internal reflection
- Two holes interference
- Newton rings
- Fabry Perot interferometer
- Fresnel diffraction plane wave
- Fresnel diffraction spherical wave

The computer experiments are used at [Twente University](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/bachelor/programmes/applied-physics/#curious) as a preparation to similar experiments in the "real optics laboratory". Watch Liesbeth's video to catch a glimpse.

Enjoy studying optics!!
