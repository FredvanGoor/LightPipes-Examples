LightPipes for Python is a set of functions written in C++ available to Python.It is designed to model coherent optical devices when the diffraction is essential.The toolbox consists of a number of functions. Each function represents an optical element or a step in the light propagation. There are apertures, intensity filters,
beam-splitters, lenses and models of free space diffraction in LightPipes.
There are also more advanced tools for manipulating the phase and amplitude of the light.
The program operates on a large data structure, containing square two-dimensional arrays
of complex amplitudes of the optical field of the propagating light beam.

LightPipes was made  by Gleb Vdovin for MSDOS and Linux.

There are also versions of LightPipes for Matlab, Octave and Mathcad. These can be obtained from:
